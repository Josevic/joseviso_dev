	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<p>I was born in Almería, Spain, on 29th September 1984, though I lived on Adra (a near town) until I was 18. During school I always felt attracted by science and gadgets. So since pretty early I was sure I wanted to study something related with computers.</p>

	<p>When the moment came I moved to Almería to start in college. I remember those years as a great time. </p>

	<p>In 2007 I finished my studies and started to work as an intern in a systems department. It was a good way of entering on the labor market, though I didn’t feel passionate about what I was doing. Half a year later I started to work as a software developer. During the following almost 3 years I was responsible for a complex project. Eventually it was an excellent learning experience about a lot of things not teached in University.</p>

	<p>I had always wanted to live for a while abroad but never made up my mind. In summer 2010 I decided to go to Dublin during my vacations to try to improve my English as much as possible.</p>

	<p>Since the beginning of 2011 and with several years of working experience, I decided to move abroad. I started checking out the different options and by April I found the possibility to go to Amsterdam to work as a web developer. So in this way my new stage in another country started.</p>

	<p>I think that was one of the greatest things I’ve ever made. I discovered new ways to see things and thinking, new hobbies and I got rid of the fear to the unknown.</p>

	<p>During that time I realized I wanted to focus my career towards facilitating the interaction between people and computers. So after one year in The Netherlands I decided to go back to Spain to work on that.</p>

	<p>Since then I live there, working as a <em>User Experience Designer</em>, learning everyday and trying out new techniques for the matters I am interested in. <em>To be continued</em>.</p>
	

	<h3 class="spacer">Studies</h3>
	<p>I studied a Bachelor degree in Computer Science in the <a href="http://cms.ual.es/UAL/en/index.htm">University of Almería</a>. During that period my favourite subjects were the ones related with software Design and User Interfaces.</p>		

	<p>Once I finished my studies I started being more interested in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability">Usability</a>, reading blogs and trying to put into practice those principles in my daily work. Then increasingly, I followed reading books and learning about the areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture">Information Architecture</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design">Interaction Design</a> up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">User Experience</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">Human-Computer Interaction</a>.</p>

	<p>During the summer of 2012 I had the good fortune to participate in the first edition of the magnificent <a href="https://class.coursera.org/hci/class/index"><em>Human-Computer Interaction online course</em></a> by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> and now I'm collaborating in it as <em>Community TA</em>.</p>


	<h3 class="spacer">Personal</h3>

	<p>I feel atracted to several diverse topics like technology, sports, languages, photography, etc. and I'm always trying to learn new things.</p>

	<p>I love science also and I try to be skeptic and apply the scientific method in my way of thinking. There is a book that marked me and I would recommend to anyone: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World">The Demon-Haunted World</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>.</p>

	<p>In addition, I follow all related to exploration of space because it looks a fascinating topic to me. Working at NASA was my dream job as a kid.</p>

	<p>On top of that, I like a lot the essence of football (soccer). In my opinion is one of the few things in the world able to inspire so many people, as well as music. My favourite team is <a href="http://www.udalmeriasad.com/">U.D. Almería</a>.</p>
